project.<br/><br/>
A. Sorry&apos; once the sales order is raised&apos; Opuvlence cannot offer cancellation for your project.<br/><br/>
Our backend teams would already have begun the sourcing and manufacturing of your
order&apos; and thus at this point&apos; we request you to honor the order and make the balance
payment as required.<br/><br/>

cancel my project. What are my options?<br/><br/>
A. With the work practically complete and your new house ready to welcome you&apos; we really
hope there will be no reason to cancel your project. Considering the time and effort invested
in sourcing&apos; manufacturing and installation&apos; Opuvlence would not be able to offer a
cancellation. We request you to kindly honour the team's ask and make the balance
payment in a timely manner.<br/><br/>

Delay Penalty<br/><br/>
What is Delay Penalty?<br/><br/>
Delay Penalty is a discount offered to customers when handovers are delayed for a period
longer than 15 days after the confirmed move-in date*. This date is communicated in the
Project Schedule after all the sales orders are raised.<br/><br/>
How much is the penalty?<br/><br/>
Penalty per day for every day&apos; beyond 15 days after the committed move in date&apos; is 0.1% of
the total Project Value.<br/><br/>
E.g.&apos; Move In Date - 1st July 2019. Project Value (net offer/ discount): INR 10&apos;00&apos;000/-. In
this case&apos; penalty of INR 1&apos;000 (0.1% of INR 10&apos;00&apos;000/-) per day will be applicable in case of
delay beyond July 16th.<br/><br/>
The maximum delay penalty payable cannot exceed 3% of the total project value.
*Move-in definition: A project is considered ready to move-in if the kitchen&apos; living&apos; bed and
bathrooms are functional. In projects with minor snags (such as replacement of a part or
whole of a functional unit&apos; delayed supply of a free-standing unit/ product&apos; snags in false
ceiling/ finishing/ electrical works etc.)&apos; the home is still considered ready to move-in as long
as the snags do not affect the functionality of the home.<br/><br/>
Functional: The snags existing will not disallow a person from living in the premises
How will the Delay Penalty be paid out?<br/><br/>
Delay penalty would be paid out through a refund to customer&#39;s bank account. However this
depends on whether 100% payment and project handover is complete.
When is the Delay Penalty not applicable?<br/><br/>
● In case there are any design changes/ modifications after communication of date of
move-in to the customer; this includes change in scope&apos; addition of scope&apos; reduction
of scope&apos; material changes&apos; finish changes&apos; aesthetic changes&apos; functional changes&apos;
or any other changes that may result in a delay in the manufacturing&apos; procurement or
execution at site.<br/><br/>
● In cases where the project involves scope of work handled by the customer&apos; then the
duration of execution of the customer&#39;s scope of work will be taken into
consideration to estimate the move-in date. This duration will be calculated after
understanding from the customer the total number of days they require to complete
their scope of work. Should the delay stem from the customer&#39;s scope of work
overshooting the budgeted days&apos; or&apos; any changes in the schedule of the customer&#39;s
scope of work&apos; move-in date will be re-estimated and any delay penalty will be
computed from the revised date.<br/><br/>
● Delay in access to the site&apos; which results in delay in execution by Opuvlence
● Restricted access to the site&apos; which results in delay in execution by Opuvlence
● Unavailability of consistent&apos; uninterrupted power or water supply to the site during
the execution phase will result in Delay Penalty not being applicable.
● In case of non-payment by the customer or partial payment or any delay in payments
as per the payment milestones&apos; Livspace will not be held responsible for delays
beyond the move-in date&apos; and&apos; hence&apos; Delay Penalty will not be applicable.
● Delay Penalty clause will not be applicable if there is any dependency on the
customer to provide approvals from any local authority and they fail to do so prior to
the start of project execution.<br/><br/>
● Opuvlence shall not be liable to pay Delay Penalty in case of any delay in production
or delivery of products ordered from third party/marketplace brands (i.e. brands
other than Opuvlence).<br/><br/>
● Force Majeure&apos; which includes&apos; but is not restricted to:<br/><br/>
● Any act of god including natural disasters&apos; floods&apos; fire&apos; earthquake&apos; typhoon&apos; cyclone
or landslides.<br/><br/>
● War&apos; riot&apos; strike&apos; lock-outs&apos; hartal/bandh&apos; accidents&apos; power failure or shortage of fuel.
● Any restrictions imposed by the central&apos; state or local statutory/government
authorities.<br/><br/>
● Any change in applicable law.<br/><br/>
● Any unforeseen supply shocks for raw materials and accessories.
● Any unforeseen manpower supply shocks.<br/><br/>

Opuvlence.<br/><br/>

Force Majeure within 72 hours from the occurrence of the Force Majeure event(s) or from
the time Opuvlence has become aware of the occurrence of such Force Majeure event(s)&apos;
whichever is later.<br/><br/>
